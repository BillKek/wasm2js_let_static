Wasm2js
=======

General Info
------------

This tool transform .wasm file to base64 encoding wrapped into javascript code, so that it can be used in a local .html file without the need for fetch() or any client server communication.

This command prints javascript wrapping code and base64 encoded wasm code

```
wasm2js wasm_file_name
```

This command saves javascript wrapping code + base64 encoded wasm code into javascript file

```
wasm2js wasm_file_name > js_file_name
```

Example
-------

Let's write trivial C++ program (example.cpp) just to ilustrate webassembly imports (print function) and exports (test function):

```
void print();

void test() {
	print();
}
```

We can compile that online at WasmExplorer: https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/ and get web assebly code:

```
(module
 (type $FUNCSIG$v (func))
 (import "env" "_Z5printv" (func $_Z5printv))
 (table 0 anyfunc)
 (memory $0 1)
 (export "memory" (memory $0))
 (export "_Z4testv" (func $_Z4testv))
 (func $_Z4testv (; 1 ;)
  (call $_Z5printv)
 )
)
```

And after than download .wasm compiled as explorer.wasm file.

Running 

```
wasm2js example.wasm 
```

gives javascript code:

```
const wasm_strbuffer = atob(AGFzbQEAAAABhICAgAABYAAAApGAgIAAAQNlbnYJX1o1cHJpbnR2AAADgoCAgAABAASEgICAAAFwAAAFg4CAgAABAAEGgYCAgAAAB5WAgIAAAgZtZW1vcnkCAAhfWjR0ZXN0dgABCoqAgIAAAYSAgIAAABAACw==);
let wasm_codearray = new Uint8Array(wasm_strbuffer.length);
for (var i in wasm_strbuffer) wasm_codearray[i] = wasm_strbuffer.charCodeAt(i);
```

So now in wasm_codearray variable we have compiled wasm code ready to be used in WebAssembly.

Because compiled C++ code adds prefix and suffix to function names (as can be seen from webassembly source) we now have "_Z5printv" instead of "print" and "_Z4testv" instead of "test". So .html file to run it all looks like:

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<HTML>
<script src="example.js"></script>
<body>
<h1>WASM TEST</H1>
<script>

imports = {};
imports["_Z5printv"] = () => { alert("Javascript code for C++ function print()"); } // imported function print()
WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm_codearray, {"env":imports})
	.then (obj => { obj.instance.exports._Z4testv(); }); // exported function test()

</script>
</BODY>
</HTML>
```


Dependencies
------------
I've used slightly modified code https://github.com/mvorbrodt/blog/blob/master/src/base64.hpp for base64 encoding/decoding.


Requirements
------------
C++14 Compiler
